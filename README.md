## Overview

Gamers are no stranger to services like Steam, XBox Live, and PlayStation Network (PSN).  GameSocial isn't much different.  Well, ok, it is slightly.  The difference is GameSocial is OpenSource, and proposed to be a "cross-platform" hub for gaming network.  Along with views into who's playing what game(s), scores, chat, co-op invites, and notifications; the plan is to also be able to set up scheduled events, tournament ladders, and much more.

GameSocial will be your one-stop shop for managing and socializing your gaming experience.  No more pre-planning to meet your friend(s) on system 'X'.  Simply load up GameSocial on your Smart Phone, Laptop, Nearby Desktop, Game Rig you are on, RaspPi, etc.  Now, play that XBox game, and when a friend sends you a request to play a PC game, choose to switch over or not...  Simple!
